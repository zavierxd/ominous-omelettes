# ok so basically
this plugin runs using lovely, the lua injector for balatro and stuff
it also runs using the (now deprecated but still functional) discord-rpc API

USE IT: 
- Lovely: https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector?tab=readme-ov-file
- discordRPC: https://github.com/pfirsich/lua-discordRPC/tree/master

# how to run ominous presence
just make a folder in the evil egg save called Mods and put OMP in there and your good. 
Oh right you might wanna download it... uhhhhh you can find it in the "Releases" tab to your right d: (o_o

# how to find evil egg save
you'll find it in C:/Users/yourusername/AppData/Roaming/EVIL EGG
otherwise if you don't know how to enable hidden files in file explorer, hit Windows+R keys and input "appdata" and it'll take you straight there

# right now i plan:
- config file (At the moment, editing OMP can only work on the main file, called "OminousPrescence.lua", I want config to be separate)
- spectate players using both discord buttons or in-game menu (but that's a massive stretch so it'll be its own mod)
- switch apis to the newer discord game sdk (it can run on c, you know who else can run on C? LUA!!!!!!)
