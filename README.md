# ok so basically
this folder runs using lovely, the lua injector for balatro and stuff
USE IT: https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector?tab=readme-ov-file

# how to run ominous presence
just make a folder in the evil egg save called Mods and put OMP in there and your good. 

# how to find evil egg save
you'll find it in C:/Users/yourusername/AppData/Roaming/EVIL EGG
otherwise if you don't know how to enable hidden files in file explorer, hit Windows+R keys and input "appdata" and it'll take you straight there

right now i plan:
- config file
- spectate players using both discord buttons or in-game menu (but that's a massive stretch so it'll be its own mod)
